    "   - Successfully extracted financial information from the policy document\n",
    "   - Preserved source information (section references)\n",
    "   - Extracted financial data (percentages, years, amounts)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vector Database Setup**:\n",
    "   - Implemented ChromaDB for efficient similarity search\n",
    "   - Used sentence transformers for semantic embeddings\n",
    "   - Demonstrated fast retrieval of relevant information\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conversation Memory**:\n",
    "   - Tracks conversation history and topics\n",
    "   - Enhances vague follow-up questions with context\n",
    "   - Maintains coherent dialogue flow\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clear Responses**:\n",
    "   - Topic-specific response formatting\n",
    "   - Source citations for transparency\n",
    "   - Helpful tips and explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Key Features Demonstrated:\n",
