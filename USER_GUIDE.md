## 🧪 **Testing Different Features**

### **A. Conversation Memory Testing**

Try this sequence to see how the chatbot remembers context:

1. **First:** "What about the budget?"
2. **Then:** "Tell me more" ← _This will be enhanced with budget context_
3. **Then:** "What about debt?"
4. **Finally:** "Tell me more" ← _This will be enhanced with debt context_

### **B. Different Response Formats**

Notice how responses change based on topic:

- **Budget questions** → 💰 Budget formatting
- **Debt questions** → 🏦 Debt formatting
- **Infrastructure questions** → 🏗️ Infrastructure formatting
- **Tax questions** → 💼 Taxation formatting

### **C. Source Citation Testing**

Every response includes:

- 📄 **Source:** Section references
- 💡 **Tips:** Helpful explanations
- **Relevant content** from the document

---

## 🔍 **Advanced Features to Explore**

### **1. Vector Search Quality**

Try these complex queries to test search accuracy:

- "What percentage targets exist for superannuation coverage?"
- "How does net interest cost relate to own-source revenue?"
- "What specific infrastructure projects are mentioned for 2005-06?"

### **2. Context Enhancement**

Test how the chatbot improves vague queries:

- Ask about a topic, then say "explain more"
- Use pronouns: "What about it?" after discussing a topic
- Try follow-up questions without context

### **3. Financial Data Extraction**

The chatbot automatically extracts:

- **Dollar amounts** (e.g., "$10 million")
- **Percentages** (e.g., "4.1%")
- **Years** (e.g., "2005-06")
- **Keywords** (budget, debt, infrastructure, etc.)

## 📋 **Sample Conversation Flow**

Here's a complete conversation to try:

```
You: "What is the government's financial policy?"
Bot: [Provides overview with sources]

You: "What about the budget specifically?"
Bot: [Budget-specific response with 💰 formatting]

You: "Is it in surplus or deficit?"
Bot: [Detailed budget status information]

You: "Tell me more"
Bot: [Enhanced response about budget using conversation memory]

You: "What about debt management?"
Bot: [Switches to debt topic with 🏦 formatting]

You: "How does this relate to the budget?"
Bot: [Connects debt and budget topics]
```

## 🛠️ **How to Customize and Extend**

### **1. Add New Documents**

- Replace `financial_policy_document.txt` with your document
- The system will automatically process and index it

### **2. Modify Response Formats**

- Edit the `_format_*_response()` methods in `chatbot.py`
- Add new emojis, formatting, or sections

### **3. Adjust Search Parameters**

- Change `chunk_size` in `DocumentProcessor` for different document sizes
- Modify `n_results` for more/fewer search results

### **4. Extend Conversation Memory**

- Add new topics to `topic_keywords` in `ConversationMemory`
- Increase `max_history` for longer memory

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

**1. Python Path Issues:**

- Restart your computer
- Disable Windows Store app aliases
- Use full Python path: `"$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe"`

**2. Package Issues:**

- Reinstall: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Use individual installs if needed

**3. Streamlit Not Opening:**

- Check if http://localhost:8501 opens in browser
- Try different port: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502`

**4. Memory Issues:**

- Reduce `chunk_size` for large documents
- Clear chat history frequently
